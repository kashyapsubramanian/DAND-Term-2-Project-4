# DAND-Term-2-Project-4
Data Story Telling. In this project, I have further explored 'Prosper Loan' dataset using Tableau

## Project Instructions

For this project, you will create a data visualization using Tableau that tells a story or highlights trends or patterns in a data set. Your work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.

## What do I need to install?

Before working on the project, you will need to have either Tableau Public or Tableau Desktop installed. You will need a software license to use Tableau Desktop. If you don't have one, you can download Tableau Public [HERE](https://public.tableau.com/s/).

## Why this Project?

This project will touch on the overarching attitudes and beliefs important to effective data visualization, such as:
- visualization is a dialog
- showcasing and sharing visualizations with others
- visualization is a fluid process that typically requires multiple iterations of improvements

You will have an opportunity to experience the end-to-end process of creating effective data visualizations and highlighting important information from data that may otherwise be hidden or hard to uncover.

## What will I learn?

After completing the project, you will be able to:
- Demonstrate the ability to choose optimal visual elements to encode data and critically assess the effectiveness of a visualization
- Communicate a story or finding to the appropriate audience using interactive visualizations
- Undergo the iterative process of creating a visualization, and build interactive visualizations with Tableau

## Introduction

For this project I have used data from `ProsperLoan`. There are around _113,937_ records with _81 columns_. Investigating the whole dataset is out of scope for this project because of the size of the dataset. I chose the **Borrower State** variable to be the focus of my analysis because, I have already worked on `ProsperLoan` dataset for EDA project where I have explored other relationships found in the data but I did not explore **Borrower State**. I took this project as a chance to explore the dataset even further.

## Questions

These are the questions that I have tried to answer.

1. How many Loans are there? How are they distributed by the Term of the Loan?

2. Does the number of Loans vary by Employment Status of the borrower? How about the number of Loans by Income Range of the borrower?

3. If people get Loan, what is the average amount requested?

4. Do people from particular Employment Status or Income Range request for more amount from others?

5. Why do people get Loan? What reason is stated by borrowers for Loan? How many Loans do we have for each of these categories?

6. How are Credit Scores of the borrower? Do we have any relationship between Credit Scores?

## Contents

The project folder contains

1. Tableau Workbook
2. Write-up in PDF format
3. Data file - the file is available in my Github repo - [DAND-Term-2-Project-2](https://github.com/kashyapsubramanian/DAND-Term-2-Project-2.git). I am not attaching the file due to the huge file size and also since it is already available in the above repo.
